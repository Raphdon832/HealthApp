## Technical Implementation

### Animation Strategy
1. **Container Animation**: `animate-fade-in` for dropdown appearance
2. **Item Animation**: `animate-fadeInUp` with staggered delays
3. **Interaction Animation**: Hover states and button feedback
4. **State Transitions**: Smooth transitions between different states

### Code Patterns
```jsx
// Staggered animation delays
style={{ animationDelay: `${index * 0.05}s` }}

// Consistent hover states  
className={`...transition-all duration-200 ${
  isSelected ? 'bg-blue-100' : 'hover:bg-blue-50'
}`}

// Search highlighting
{text.split(new RegExp(`(${query})`, 'gi')).map((part, i) =>
  part.toLowerCase() === query.toLowerCase() ? (
    <span key={i} className="bg-yellow-200 px-1 rounded">{part}</span>
  ) : part
)}
```
